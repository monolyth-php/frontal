# Flashing people
Don't worry, this module's name is very tongue-in-cheek and has nothing to do
with exposing your privates.

A "flash message" is a one-off message that should be shown to a visitor only
once, and then self-destruct. Typically they're feedback generated by some
action that was performed, e.g. "Changes saved" or "There was an error" (though
the last one ought to be slightly more helpful...).

`Booby` is a small module that allows you to generate messages anywhere in your
code. You can then retrieve them in your template and display them.

@@ Example
```php
<?php

use Booby\Flash;

class SomeModel
{
    public function someAction()
    {
        // Whatever success is...
        if (success()) {
            Flash::me('Yay!');
            // Stuff should return null on success, i.e. "nothing to report"
            return null;
        } else {
            Flash::me("Sorry, that didn't work me. :(");
            // On error return anything non-null
            return 'error';
        }
    }
}
```

Depending on `success()` we now have a message to show. In our main View we can
now do something like this:

```php
    public function __invoke(array $data)
    {
        $data['messages'] = Flash::all();
    }
```

...and in the template conditionally display and format them:

```html
{% if messages %}
<ul class="messages">
    {% for message in messages %}
    <li>{{ message }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
{% endif %}
```

You can also use `Flash::each()` to retrieve the next message. Messages
self-destruct after they are `__toString`'d.
