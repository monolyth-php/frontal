# Handling forms
We suggest [Formulaic](http://formulaic.monomelodies.nl) to handle forms. This
also plays nicely with [Ornament](orm.md) in that you can bind models to forms
so everything gets updated automagically. Formulaic also offers a wealth of
error checking helpers, and is extremely flexible in its output (automated,
overrideable, or roll your own using the form object).

Explaining how this all works goes way beyond the scope of this documentation,
so if you're up for some form automation have a look at their documentation.
